ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Kaung Khant!
ðŸ’» Iâ€™m passionate about building websites and exploring the modern technology.
ðŸš´ When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me cycling and pushing myself to go a little further every ride.
ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into the MERN stack and Laravel, sharpening my full-stack skills one project at a time.
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Grade 11 student with big goals to keep growing, learning, and creating cool stuff.
